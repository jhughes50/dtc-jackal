### Waypoint Nav
A QD ros node for waypoint navigation. This will parse a `.kml` file and navigatge to the waypoints. It needs a heading source from odometry and gps.
You can generate a `kml` with Google Earth or QGroundControl, I recommend the latter.

Run with `roslaunch waypoint_nav waypoint_nav_node.py`
